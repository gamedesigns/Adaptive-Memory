## ðŸŽ¯ Game Concept

Adaptive Memory is an experimental pattern recognition game designed to test evolving gameplay principles and novel interaction mechanics. Unlike traditional memory games with static difficulty curves, this game dynamically adapts to player performance, introducing new gameplay elements and challenges based on skill progression.

The core research focuses on:
- **Adaptive Difficulty Systems** - How games can intelligently respond to player capability
- **Evolving Interaction Patterns** - Introduction of new mechanics that build upon mastered skills
- **Player Retention through Progression** - Balancing challenge and reward to maintain engagement
- **Cognitive Load Management** - Testing optimal information presentation and timing

## Research Objectives

### Primary Research Questions:
1. **Can games effectively adapt their core mechanics in real-time based on player performance?**
2. **How do evolving interaction patterns affect player learning curves and retention?**
3. **What is the optimal balance between familiar and novel mechanics in progressive gameplay?**
4. **How does adaptive difficulty impact player motivation compared to static progression?**

### Tested Interaction Principles:
- **Progressive Complexity** - Gradual introduction of advanced pattern types
- **Skill-Based Rewards** - Life regeneration through demonstrated mastery
- **Adaptive Feedback Systems** - Visual and audio cues that evolve with player skill
- **Dynamic Challenge Scaling** - Real-time adjustment of game parameters

## Gameplay Features

### Core Mechanics
- **Pattern Recognition** - Observe and replicate increasingly complex color sequences
- **Lives System** - Strategic risk/reward balance with regeneration opportunities
- **Adaptive Difficulty** - Three base difficulty levels with dynamic scaling
- **Combo System** - Rewards consistent performance with bonus scoring

### Evolving Gameplay Elements
- **Pattern Type Evolution** (Level 4+)
  - **Reverse Patterns** - Sequences played in reverse order
  - **Double-Tap Patterns** - Each color must be repeated twice
  - **Mixed Pattern Types** - Random combination of all pattern types

- **Visual Feedback Evolution** (Level 6+)
  - **Animation Variations** - Alternating between bounce and scale effects
  - **Enhanced Highlighting** - More dramatic visual cues for advanced patterns

- **Regenerative Mechanics**
  - **Skill-Based Life Recovery** - Earn lives through consecutive successful patterns
  - **Scaling Requirements** - Combo thresholds increase with player progression

### Adaptive Systems
- **Dynamic Pattern Length** - Automatically adjusts based on difficulty and level
- **Timing Adaptation** - Display speed varies with difficulty selection
- **Color Complexity** - Additional colors introduced at higher difficulties
- **Audio Feedback** - Musical progression that matches visual complexity

## Technical Features

- **Zero Dependencies** - Pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- **Persistent Storage** - Local high score tracking
- **Accessibility** - Screen reader compatible with keyboard navigation
- **Performance Optimized** - Efficient audio context and memory management
